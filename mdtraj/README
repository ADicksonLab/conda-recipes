As of version 1.8.0, MDTraj is built entirely by the conda-forge
infrastructure. Please make any future releases here:

https://github.com/conda-forge/mdtraj-feedstock

This is discussed further here:

https://github.com/omnia-md/conda-recipes/issues/634

For backwards compatibility, the built binaries are copied
to the anaconda.org/omnia channel. How to do this:
